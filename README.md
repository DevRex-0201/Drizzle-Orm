## Drizzle ORM
DrizzleORM is a TypeScript ORM library with a [drizzle-kit](#migrations) CLI companion for automatic SQL migrations generation. 
It's meant to be a library, not a framework, stay as an opt-in solution all the time at any levels. 
We try to follow SQL-like syntax whenever possible, be strongly typed ground top and fail in compile time, not in runtime. 
We implemented best in class `joins` and second to none `migrations generation`. 
Library has almost zero dependencies and being battle tested on production projects by multiple teams üöÄ
