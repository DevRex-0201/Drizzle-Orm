We have specific rules on how commit messages should be structured. 

It's important to make sure your commit messages are clear, concise, and informative to make it easier for others to understand the changes you are making

Commit message patten
```
<package name>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```
Example
```
drizzle-orm: [Pg] Add groupBy error message

In specific case, groupBy was responding with unreadable error
...
```

### <a name="pr-guideline"></a> PR guideline
---
Each PR should be created from a branch, that was named by our pattern
```
<type>/<name>
```
Example
```
feature/groupby
fix/groupby-message-fix
```

List of possible types for branch name
- feature
- fix
- bug
- docs

---
Each PR should contain:
- Tests on feature, that was created 
- Tests on bugs, that was fixed
